Create Firebase Real Time Database, get url.

10.208-209
npm install axios, create a global instance, send POST request to Firebase.

210
Show a spinner while sending request. Grab spinner css from web, render spinner when loading state is true. Modify condition in Modal's shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle to correctly rerender Modal to show spinner.

211
Handle HTTP errors. Create a WithErrorHandler component which returns a function that can wraps other component. Use axios.interceptors to handle errors. Click on Modal to dismiss error message.

212
Move state.ingredients to Firebase, retrieve it from server when app loads. Update code to avoid null errors. In WithErrorHandler, Change componentDidMount to WillMount(deprecated, can consider using constructor lifecycle), to handle network connection error.

213
To avoid repetitive interceptors & memory leak, remove interceptors when WithErrorHandler's anonymouse class component get unmounted. Write some testing code in App.js, will remove soon.
